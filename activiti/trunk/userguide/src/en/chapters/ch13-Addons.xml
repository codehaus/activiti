    <title>Camunda Fox</title>
	  <para>
	    <ulink url="http://fox.camunda.com/doc/#cycle">Camunda Fox</ulink> started off as Activiti Cycle and now has turned into a fully 
	    fledged individual project at <ulink url="http://camunda.com">Camunda</ulink>. 
	    Camunda Fox is a web application that provides a collaborative platform for different stakeholders 
	    of BPM projects (Business, developers, IT operations, ...).
	    It combines different repositories like the Activiti Modeler repository, Subversion or your local file system into a single view, 
	    which makes it easy to browse all the artifacts that are involved in the process of creating an executable business process. 
	    In addition to this, Camunda Fox provides built in actions like moving artifacts between repositories or downloading different
	    formats of process models, and a plug-in infrastructure for custom actions.
